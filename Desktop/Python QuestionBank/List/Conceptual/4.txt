4.When would you use a list vs a tuple?

Use a list when you need a mutable sequence:
Elements can be added, removed, or changed.
Example: storing data that may change, like a to-do list or dynamic dataset.

Use a tuple when you need an immutable sequence:
Elements cannot be changed, so itâ€™s safer for fixed data.
Example: storing coordinates (x, y), RGB values, or dictionary keys.
