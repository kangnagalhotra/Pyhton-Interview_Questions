2.How are lists stored in memory (mutable property)?

Lists are mutable, so their elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation.
In memory, a list stores references (pointers) to objects, not the actual values themselves.
Because of this, when you modify a list (e.g., append, insert), the list object stays at the same memory location, but its contents (the references) are updated.
This is why lists are mutable and changes affect the original list.
