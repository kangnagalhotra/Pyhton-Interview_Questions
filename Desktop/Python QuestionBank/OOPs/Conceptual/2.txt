2. Difference between method overloading and overriding.

Method Overloading → Same method name, different number or type of parameters in the same class.
Python doesn’t support it directly, but you can use default or *args parameters.

Method Overriding → A child class defines a method with the same name as a method in the parent class.
Used to change or extend behavior.
