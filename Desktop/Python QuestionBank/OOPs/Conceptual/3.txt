3. What is multiple inheritance? Any drawbacks?

When a class inherits from more than one parent class, it’s called multiple inheritance.
class Parent1:
    def func1(self):
        print("Parent1 function")

class Parent2:
    def func2(self):
        print("Parent2 function")

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    pass

c = Child()
c.func1()  # Parent1 function
c.func2()  # Parent2 function

Drawbacks / Problems
Diamond problem – ambiguity when multiple parents have the same method.
Code complexity – harder to read, maintain, and debug.
Method resolution order (MRO) – Python uses MRO to decide which parent method to call, which can confuse beginners.
