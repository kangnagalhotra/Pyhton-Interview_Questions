4. Explain DictReader and DictWriter.

. csv.DictReader
Reads a CSV file into a sequence of OrderedDict objects.
Each row is a dictionary where keys are column headers and values are row data.

2. csv.DictWriter
Writes data to a CSV file from dictionaries.
You define fieldnames (column headers).
Each dictionary you write must have keys matching the fieldnames.
