1. What are hashmaps? How are they related to Python dictionaries?

A hashmap is a data structure that stores data as key-value pairs.

In Python, dictionaries (dict) are implemented as hashmaps.
Keys in a dictionary must be hashable (immutable types like strings, numbers, tuples).
Values can be of any type.
This allows Python dictionaries to have fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
