2. Explain scope of variables (local, global, nonlocal).

. Local Scope
Variables defined inside a function.
Accessible only within that function.

. Global Scope
Variables defined outside all functions.
Accessible anywhere in the program, unless shadowed by a local variable.

. Nonlocal Scope
Used in nested functions.
Refers to a variable in the nearest enclosing (non-global) scope.
