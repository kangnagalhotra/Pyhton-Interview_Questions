2. What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages?

Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) translate the whole code into machine code before execution, making them faster.
Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) translate code line by line at runtime, making them slower but more flexible and easier to debug.
