1. Why are tuples faster than lists?

Immutability
Tuples cannot be changed after creation.
Python can optimize memory allocation and access because it knows the contents won’t change.

Less memory overhead
Lists store extra information to support dynamic resizing (adding/removing elements).
Tuples don’t need this extra space, making them lighter and quicker.

Faster operations
Accessing tuple elements is slightly faster than list elements.
No overhead for methods that modify content (like append, extend, etc.).
