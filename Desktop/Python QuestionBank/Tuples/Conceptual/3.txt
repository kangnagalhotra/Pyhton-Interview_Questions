3.How are tuples used as dictionary keys?

Tuples can be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable. In Python, dictionary keys must be hashable, which generally means their value cannot change.
Immutable objects (like tuples, strings, numbers) are hashable.
Mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, sets) are not hashable and cannot be used as keys.
