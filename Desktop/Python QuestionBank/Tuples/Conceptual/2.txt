2.Can a tuple contain mutable elements?

Yes, a tuple can contain mutable elements, such as lists or dictionaries.
The tuple itself is immutable, meaning you cannot change which objects are in the tuple or their order.
However, if a tuple contains a mutable object, that object can be modified.

t = (1, 2, [3, 4])
t[2].append(5)   # modifies the list inside the tuple
print(t)          # Output: (1, 2, [3, 4, 5])

# t[0] = 10  --> ❌ Error: cannot change tuple elements
